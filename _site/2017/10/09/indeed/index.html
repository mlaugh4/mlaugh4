It’s a big swing initiative to shift communication away from email and toward real-time chat. Our v1 recently shipped and is trending positively across all KPIs in A/B testing. 🤞</p><h6 id="agenda">Agenda</h6><p>This case study is an abstract overview of the genesis, early development, optimization, and vision for employer messaging. I do my best to supplement the story with relevant visuals and summarize my involvement at each step.</p><hr /><h3 id="overview">Overview</h3><h5 id="business-context">Business context</h5><ul><li>Black hole (unresponsive employers) has been the biggest job seeker complaint since Indeed’s inception. Only 9.5% of job applications get a response</li><li>Lack of visibility into hiring outcomes: Employers lacked a centralized view of all their conversations, pushing 70% of them out of the app and into email</li><li>Employers using different products have a disjointed user experience</li><li>Templates are a critical part of their messaging workflow, but we lack proper management tools</li></ul><h5 id="design-challenges">Design challenges</h5><ul><li>Make messaging feel lighter and faster by challenging email as the status quo for hiring communication.</li><li>Balance requirements from over eight teams around the world</li><li>Provide sufficient marginal value over email to drive adoption of Indeed messaging</li><li>Successfully transition away from email without alienating users</li></ul><h5 id="project-details">Project details</h5><ul><li><strong>Role:</strong> UX lead</li><li><strong>Team:</strong> 2 designers, 1 design technologist, 1 user researcher. Extended team includes 7 developers, 1 PM, and 2 QA. </li><li><strong>Output:</strong> End-to-end messaging application on mobile and desktop. </li><li><strong>Highlights:</strong> Working with a brilliant product manager and team of engineers. Presenting to SLT &amp; 100+ designers across the org. Created demo that SVP of Product presented at Indeed Interactive. Shipped major redesign of core employer experience that’s used my tens of millions of people worldwide.</li></ul><h5 id="before--after">Before &amp; after</h5><p><img src="/assets/images/indeed/messaging/beforeAfter.png" alt="Placeholder" /></p><div class="greyDiv"><div class="grid"><div class="smll">Phase 1</div><h2> Foundational user research &amp; synthesis</h2><p> Following a 40+ person sprint, we had a full team of engineers in the wings and very little user research to inform our product roadmap. As a result, a researcher and I launched a campaign to collect qualitative knowledge every week. Our research included:</p><ul><li>Synthesis of past research and experimentation in employer communication</li><li>Digging into interaction logs to get baseline understanding of user behavior (e.g. conversation/message length, platform, response times)</li><li>On-site interviews with users</li><li>Show-me sessions with existing messaging</li><li>In-app surveys</li><li>Rapid prototyping and moderated usability testing</li></ul><h5>Key flows</h5><p>A key output from this phase were three abstracted flows that aligned job seeker and employer vision</p><img src="/assets/images/indeed/messaging/keyflows.png" /><p> <strong>My contribution:</strong> Collected and summarized past research. Battled with SQL to get behavioral insight. Attended on-sites and observed show-me sessions. Designed in-app survey.</p><p> Maintained high-contact between cross-team stakeholders, design technologist, researcher, PM, and other designers to report out findings and share designs.</p><p> Partnered with product management to shape OKRs and MVP specification based on research, technical constraints, and company objectives.</p></div></div><div class="smll">Phase 2</div><h2 id="weekly-design-prototyping--usability-research-sprints">Weekly design, prototyping &amp; usability research sprints</h2><p>A typical UX has a healthy buffer between design, prototype development, and research. Given our aggressive timeline (we were simultaneously researching and building features for the first couple months 😬), our transition from foundational user research to prototyping and evaluation was abrupt. We were forced to bundle design and prototyping into one exercise.</p><p>I partnered with a design technologist and researcher to generate a high fidelity prototype that was used for stakeholder communication and weekly sessions at the usability lab. Within 7-day sprints, we summarized research findings, adjusted designs, iterated with product stakeholders, communicated changes to developers, revised the prototype, and created research plan.</p><p><strong>My contribution:</strong> Grand liason. Observed all research sessions and iterated mobile and desktop designs based on observations and internal product feedback. Produced extensive behavioral specifications to accompany prototype that shared referenced with developer team.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/indeed/messaging/uxLab.jpg" alt="Placeholder" /> <small>The battleground, aka UX lab</small></p><div class="greyDiv"><div class="grid"><div class="smll">Phase 3</div><h2>Ongoing optimization &amp; experimentation</h2><p> Following launch and stabilization, I spent most lunch hours sitting in a conference room with my PM watching session recordings (actual users in prod), and categorizing monthly survey feedback. We collected observed themes and brainstormed solutions with the team. Winning concepts were specified and foled into the prtotype, put into usertesting.com studies, and we generated quick improvements that had measurable impact on CS complaints.</p><h5>Hotjar recording + categorized feedback from our monthly pulse survey</h5><img src="/assets/images/indeed/messaging/postLaunchResearch.png" /><p> <strong>My contribution:</strong> Categorized thousands of lines of survey results. Led a brainstorming session with wider team. Worked with user researcher to run usertesting studies. Created improvement tickets.</p></div></div><div class="smll">Phase 4</div><h2 id="post-mvp-shapingroadmap">Post-MVP: Shaping roadmap</h2><p>Following the initial few months of mayhem, we fell back into our regular cadence of research. The foundation was set, we had bandwidth, and were far enough ahead of our engineering roadmap to lift our heads and think about our vision. A few concepts we researched:</p><h5 id="voice-introductions">Voice introductions</h5><p><img src="/assets/images/indeed/messaging/audioIntros.png" alt="Voice intros" /></p><h5 id="framework-for-enriched-messaging">Framework for ‘enriched messaging’</h5><p>Hybrid graphical and text conversation interface.
