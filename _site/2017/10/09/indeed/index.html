It‚Äôs a big swing initiative to shift communication away from email and toward real-time chat as part of a wider effort to close the ‚Äúblack hole.‚Äù v1 shipped over the summer and is trending positively across all KPIs. ü§û</p><p>The following is a high-level overview of the genesis, research, early development, optimization, and vision for employer messaging.</p><hr /><h2 id="overview">Overview</h2><p><img src="/assets/images/indeed/messaging/inboxOverview.png" alt="Placeholder" /></p><h5 id="business-context">Business context</h5><ul><li>Black hole (unresponsive employers) has been the biggest job seeker complaint since Indeed‚Äôs inception. Only 9.5% of job applications get a response.</li><li>We have limited visibility into hiring outcomes. We failed to provide basic functionality and a centralized view of all conversations, which pushed 70% of employer communication out of the platform.</li><li>Employers using different Indeed products have a disjointed user experience.</li><li>Templates are a critical part of their messaging workflow and we lacked proper management tools.</li></ul><h5 id="design-challenges">Design challenges</h5><ul><li>Make messaging feel lighter and faster by challenging email as the status quo for hiring communication.</li><li>Balance requirements from over eight teams around the world.</li><li>Provide sufficient marginal value over email to bring messaging activity back into the platform.</li></ul><h5 id="project-details">Project details</h5><ul><li><strong>Role:</strong> UX lead</li><li><strong>Team:</strong> 2 designers, 1 design technologist, 1 user researcher. Extended team includes 7 developers, 1 PM, and 2 QA.¬†</li><li><strong>Output:</strong> Messaging application on mobile and desktop.¬†</li><li><strong>Highlights:</strong> Working with a brilliant product manager and engineers. Presenting to SLT &amp; 100+ designers across the org. Creating demo that SVP of Product presented at major HR conference.

As a result, a researcher and I launched a campaign to collect qualitative knowledge every week for two months. Our research included:</p><ul><li>Synthesis of past research and experimentation in employer communication</li><li>Digging into interaction logs to get baseline understanding of user behavior (e.g. conversation/message length, message contents, response times)</li><li>On-site interviews with users</li><li>Show-me sessions with existing messaging</li><li>In-app surveys</li><li>Rapid prototyping and moderated usability testing</li></ul><h5>Key flows</h5><p>A key output from this phase were three abstracted flows that aligned job seeker and employer vision</p><img src="/assets/images/indeed/messaging/keyflows.png" /><p> <strong>My contribution:</strong> Collected and summarized past research. Battled with SQL to get behavioral insight. Attended on-sites and observed show-me sessions. Designed in-app survey.</p><p> Maintained high-contact between cross-team stakeholders, design technologist, researcher, PM, and other designers to report out findings and share designs.</p><p> Partnered with product management to shape OKRs and MVP specification based on research, technical constraints, and company objectives.</p></div></div><div class="smll">Phase 2</div><h2 id="weekly-design-prototyping--usability-research-sprints">Weekly design, prototyping &amp; usability research sprints</h2><p>A typical UX has a healthy buffer between design, prototype development, and research. Given our aggressive timeline (we were simultaneously researching and building features for the first couple months üò¨), our transition from foundational user research to prototyping and evaluation was abrupt. We were forced to bundle design and prototyping into one exercise.</p><p>I partnered with a design technologist and researcher to generate a high fidelity prototype that was used for stakeholder communication and weekly sessions at the usability lab. Within 7-day sprints, we summarized research findings, adjusted designs, iterated with product stakeholders, communicated changes to developers, revised the prototype, and created research plan.</p><p><strong>My contribution:</strong> Grand liason. Observed all research sessions and iterated mobile and desktop designs based on observations and internal product feedback. Produced extensive behavioral specifications to accompany prototype that shared referenced with developer team.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/indeed/messaging/uxLab.jpg" alt="Placeholder" /> <small>The battleground, aka UX lab</small></p><div class="greyDiv"><div class="grid"><div class="smll">Phase 3</div><h2>Ongoing optimization &amp; experimentation</h2><p> Following launch and stabilization, I spent lunches sitting in a room with my PM watching session recordings (actual users in prod), and categorizing feedback from our monthly pulse survey. We took observed issues back to the team to find solutions. After quick brainstorming sessions, winning concepts were pulled into the research prototype and gut-checked on usertesting.com. This improvement process was powerful in ensuring seamless UX and effectively reduced CS tickets.</p><h5>Hotjar recording + categorized feedback from our monthly pulse survey</h5><img src="/assets/images/indeed/messaging/postLaunchResearch.png" /><p> <strong>My contribution:</strong> Categorized thousands of lines of survey results. Led a brainstorming session with wider team. Worked with design technologist and user researcher to run usertesting studies. Created improvement tickets for developers.</p></div></div><div class="smll">Phase 4</div><h2 id="post-mvp-shapingroadmap">Post-MVP: Shaping¬†roadmap</h2><p>Following the initial mayhem, we fell back into our regular cadence of research and delivery. The foundation was set, we had bandwidth, and were far enough ahead of our engineering roadmap to lift our heads and think about our vision.
