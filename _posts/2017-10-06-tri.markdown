As part of a (successful ðŸ˜€) interview process for Toyota Research Institute for Advanced Development (<a href="https://www.tri-ad.global/" target="_blank">TRI-AD</a>), I was asked to explore how a 3-screen Toyota instrument cluster might respond to a flat tire. 

<b>Goal:</b> Stagger information across the screens without accosting drivers to ensure their eyes remain on the road.



This was completed and shared with the VP of Design at TRI-AD.
