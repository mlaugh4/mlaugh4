I currently work at Indeed to help employers quickly find hires. Recent projects include a 2-year vision for the employer mobile app, a complete redesign of the messaging experience, and an internal tool for cross-team knowledge sharing. I work closely with product managers on strategy, user researchers on generative and evaluative research, content strategists on voice, and engineering to ensure quality input and output. I view trust as the central fulcrum to a productive team and seek to promote creativity from all corners of the office (and from users!)
