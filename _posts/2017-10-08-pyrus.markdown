For two years I worked with doctors in Seattle and Canada to improve MRI/CT imaging. We focused on VR software for perioperative education and AR-based navigation for minimally-invasive procedures.
<h5>Key contributions</h5>
* Created <mark>business plan</mark> and prototype to secure initial grant
* Built web-based model management app in React
* Built <mark>VR interface</mark> in Unity
* Created novel VR input model, ‘Touch Motion,’ that combines Oculus Touch and Leap Motion
* Designed interface for <mark>HoloLens mobile controller</mark>
* Lead user research -- <mark>contextual inquiry and usability analyses</mark> with docs

  <h4>Key design challenges</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Maintaining a user-centered approach in a highly regulated, complex technical environment with a broad constituency</li>
    <li>Discovery & learning: Building relationships with hospitals and practitioners to establish consistent feedback loop</li>
    <li>Control in VR: Identifying ideal input model that's learnable, precise, and natural</li>
    <li>Model managament: Streamlining the process of importing DICOM images from workstations and presenting them in VR</li>
    <li>Designing for inclusion: After a year of R&D in VR, we shifted gears to focus on AR.</li>

## Maintaining a user-centered approach in a highly regulated, complex technical environment with a broad constituency


##### Solution: Business and product due diligence

Abstracted and simulaneous product and business planning helped identify tertiary audiences, contextual/regulatory constraints, and aligned all members of the team around key milestones and deliverables. In the face of innate startup chaos and enigmatic requirements, perpetual famine, and complex healthcare go-to-market, planning helped clarify milestones, recognize wider market trends, and necessary hoops to jump through on the way.

##### Solution: Problem mapping

Challenge | Outcome
------------ | -------------
Complex service environment | Clarity and scope of problem
Diverse constituency | Understanding of players and influences
Many potential use cases | Artifact for use in interviews

<h5>Solution: The play-pen on wheels</h5>
Anyone who's developed for VR is familiar with the literal hardware baggage involved. We spent half the week outside of the office (and moved between hospitals on a scooter!) and our caravan was quickly known as he play-pen on wheels. Though this was a joke at the time, I now reconize this as one of the most important metaphors
