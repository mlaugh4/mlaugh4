For two years I worked with doctors in Seattle and Canada to improve MRI/CT imaging. We focused on VR software for perioperative education and AR-based navigation for minimally-invasive procedures.
<h5>Key contributions</h5>
* Created <mark>business plan</mark> and prototype to secure initial grant
* Built web-based model management app in React
* Built <mark>VR interface</mark> in Unity
* Created novel VR input model, ‘Touch Motion,’ that combines Oculus Touch and Leap Motion
* Designed interface for <mark>HoloLens mobile controller</mark>
* Lead user research -- <mark>contextual inquiry and usability analyses</mark> with docs

## Maintaining a user-centered approach in a highly regulated, complex technical environment with a broad constituency


##### Solution: Business and product due diligence

Abstracted and simulaneous product and business planning helped identify tertiary audiences, contextual/regulatory constraints, and aligned all members of the team around key milestones and deliverables. In the face of innate startup chaos and enigmatic requirements, perpetual famine, and complex healthcare go-to-market, planning helped clarify milestones, recognize wider market trends, and necessary hoops to jump through on the way.

##### Solution: Problem mapping

Challenge | Outcome
------------ | -------------
Complex service environment | Clarity and scope of problem
Diverse constituency | Understanding of players and influences
Many potential use cases | Artifact for use in interviews

<h5>Solution: The play-pen on wheels</h5>
Anyone who's developed for VR is familiar with the literal hardware baggage involved. We spent half the week outside of the office (and moved between hospitals on a scooter!) and our caravan was quickly known as he play-pen on wheels. Though this was a joke at the time, I now reconize this as one of the most important metaphors

<div class="smll">Challenge 3</div>
## Control in VR: Identifying ideal input model that's learnable, precise, and natural

The biggest design challenge was figuring out how to users  accomodate ‘natural’ gestures with efficient, precise, and predictable input?

##### Experiment 1: Google Cardboard

Benefits | Drawbacks
------------ | -------------
Mobile; lightweight & accessible | Way too limited (just gaze and one button)
 | Laggy with big models

##### Experiment 2: DK2 + Leap Motion

Benefits | Drawbacks
------------ | -------------
Hardware light (no controller to learn) | Tracking: Unpredictable & imprecise
Basic controls are intuitive | IR silhouette intersection

##### Experiment 3: Xbox controller

Benefits | Drawbacks
------------ | -------------
Predictable & Comforable | Difficult to extract substructures
Lots of input options | Doctors hated it; felt like gaming.

##### Experiment 4: Perception Neuron

Benefits | Drawbacks
------------ | -------------
Performant & Precise tracking | Way too much configuration
 | Clunky, fragile hardware

 ##### Experiment 5: Touch motion
