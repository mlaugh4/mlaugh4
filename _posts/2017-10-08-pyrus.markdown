I spent two years working with doctors in Seattle and Canada to improve MRI/CT imaging. We focused on VR software for perioperative education and AR-based navigation for minimally-invasive procedures.
<h5>Key contributions</h5>
* Created <mark>business plan</mark> and prototype to secure initial grant
* Developed model management app in React.js
* Built <mark>VR interface</mark> in Unity
* Designed & researched first-of-its-kind VR input model, ‘Touch Motion,’ that combines Oculus Touch and Leap Motion
* Created mobile app that used sockets to connect to a HoloLens and function as a input device
* Led frequent <mark>contextual inquiry and usability analyses</mark> with doctors

## Maintaining a user-centered approach in a highly regulated, complex technical environment with a broad constituency


##### Solution 1: Up-front due diligence

![Placeholder](/assets/images/pyrus/product_plan.png)

Abstracted product and business planning helped identify tertiary audiences, contextual/regulatory constraints, and aligned all members of the team around key milestones and deliverables. In the face of enigmatic requirements, perpetual famine, and complex healthcare go-to-market, up-front planning helped clarify milestones, recognize wider market trends, and navigate the regulatory labrynth.

##### Solution: Problem mapping

Challenge | Outcome
------------ | -------------
Complex service environment | Clarity and scope of problem
Diverse constituency | Understanding of disparate needs and influences
Many potential use cases | Artifact for use in interviews

    <h5>Solution: Rolling play-pen</h5>
    <p>
    Anyone who's experimented with VR is familiar with the rats nest of sensors and cables. We spent half the week outside of the office (with a scooter as our primary mode of transportation!) and our caravan was branded the "rolling play-pen." Though we laughed at the time, I now realize it was this tactic that guaranteed our success.

<div class="smll">Challenge 3</div>
## Control in VR: Identifying ideal input model that's learnable, precise, and natural

Our <mark>biggest design challenge</mark> was figuring out how to  accomodate ‘natural’ gestures with efficient, precise, and predictable input. Efficiency is critical for doctors and they had a low threshold for onboarding and recall. This was the most important part of our user experience and where we invested the most in research. The following highlights key steps in our investigation.

##### Experiment 1: Google Cardboard

Benefits | Drawbacks
------------ | -------------
Mobile; lightweight & accessible | Way too limited (just gaze and one button)
 | Laggy with big models

##### Experiment 2: DK2 + Leap Motion

![Placeholder](/assets/images/pyrus/exp2_dk.png)

Benefits | Drawbacks
------------ | -------------
Hardware light (no controller to learn) | Tracking: Unpredictable & imprecise
Basic controls are intuitive | IR silhouette intersection

##### Experiment 3: Xbox controller

Benefits | Drawbacks
------------ | -------------
Predictable & Comforable | Difficult to extract substructures
Lots of input options | Doctors hated it; felt like gaming.

##### Experiment 4: Perception Neuron

Benefits | Drawbacks
------------ | -------------
Performant & Precise tracking | Way too much configuration
 | Clunky, fragile hardware

##### Experiment 5: Touch motion ❤️

    <h2>Action menu with touch motion</h2>
    <p>Touch motion hit the sweet spot between precision and intuition. Our next challenge was to create an efficient system for switching between modes and tools.</p>
    <h5>v1: Pane</h5>
    <img src="/assets/images/pyrus/touchmotion.png">
    <p>Users summoned a menu with the controller and selected actions with their free hand. This was easy to create using Unity Canvas and Leap Motion button elements, but it wasn't scalable and prone to selection error.</p>
    
    <h5>v2: Radial menu</h5>
