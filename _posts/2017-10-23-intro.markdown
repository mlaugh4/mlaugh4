I love design. 

I'm based in Tokyo and have four years of experience shipping mobile and virtual/augmented reality applications. Having spent most of my professional life in smaller product teams, I've had opportunities to sharpen my skills across all points in the UX spectrum. That said, my path into design was by way of analytics, and have grown to recognize the importance of outcome-driven design and product strategy. IDEO's "Talk less, do more" axiom and "build-to-think" methodology are core tenets to my approach, and I find my flow in the interaction design, prototyping, and research loop. I've found this is where UX investment pays dividends, as it quickly generates tangible product and user knowledge.

I currently work at Indeed to help employers quickly find hires. Recent projects include a 2-year vision for the employer mobile app, a complete redesign of the messaging experience, and an internal tool for cross-team knowledge sharing. I work closely with product managers on strategy, user researchers on generative and evaluative research, content strategists on voice, and engineering to ensure quality input and output. I view trust as the central fulcrum to a productive team and seek to promote creativity from all corners of the office (and from users!)

Finally, having worked on teams in Seattle, New York, Austin, Nairobi, Saigon, and Tokyo, I recognize the importance of disparate views, cultures, and life experiences as ingredients to a truly user-centered product. Unless I'm making a grilled cheese, I try to avoid self-reference and love learning from smart folks around me.
