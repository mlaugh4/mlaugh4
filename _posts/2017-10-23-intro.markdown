I love design. 

My name is Mark Laughery, and I'm a UX designer in Tokyo with four years of experience shipping mobile and virtual/augmented reality applications. Having spent most of my professional life in smaller product teams, I've had opportunities to sharpen my skills across every end of the UX spectrum. I enjoy all of it, but my path into design was by way of analytics and I've grown to recognize the importance of outcome-driven design and product strategy. IDEO's "Talk less, do more" axiom and "build-to-think" methodology are core tenets to my approach, and I find my flow in the interaction design, prototyping, and research loop.

I currently work on Indeed's employer product. Recent projects include a 2-year vision for the employer mobile app, a complete redesign of the messaging experience, and an internal tool for cross-team knowledge sharing. I work closely with product managers on strategy, user researchers on generative and evaluative research, content strategists on voice, and engineering to ensure quality input and output. I view trust as the central fulcrum to a productive team and seek to promote creativity from all corners of the office (and from users!)

Finally, having worked on teams in Seattle, New York, Austin, Nairobi, Saigon, and Tokyo, I recognize the importance of disparate views, cultures, and life experiences as ingredients to a truly user-centered product. Unless I'm making a grilled cheese, I try to avoid self-reference and love learning from smart folks around me.
